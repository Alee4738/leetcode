# Personal Leetcode Repository

My solutions to leetcode questions. Most of the solutions are in Python, but I'm moving to TypeScript (there are some old JS ones).

## Usage

### TypeScript

- Terminal

```
npx jasmine-ts
```

- To focus on a certain file

  - Go to the file
  - Change `describe` to `fdescribe`
  - Rerun npx jasmine-ts

- Debugging with VS Code
  - Open to the .ts file to debug
  - Set breakpoints
  - Use the "Jasmine (TS) Current File" debug profile

### Python

```
python3 <file>
```

### JavaScript

```
npx jasmine <file>
```
