# Personal Leetcode Repository

My solutions to leetcode questions. Most of the solutions are in Python, but I'm moving to TypeScript (there are some old JS ones).

## Usage

### TypeScript

- Terminal

```bash
npm test
```

- Jasmine supports focusing on or ignoring tests

  - 'f' to focus on a spec/test
    - `fdescribe` or `fit`
  - 'x' to ignore a spec/test
    - `xdescribe` or `xit`

- Debugging with VS Code
  - Open to the .ts file to debug
  - Set breakpoints
  - Use the "Jasmine (TS) Current File" debug profile

### Python

```
python3 <file>
```

### JavaScript

```
npx jasmine <file>
```
